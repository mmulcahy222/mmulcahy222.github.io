<p>I've done a freelance job in December 2016 on Upwork, and I was a new Python Developer after working with PHP for 10 years, and Java for 3 years before that. My first Python project ever was to get the comments of a Disqus comments section and put all the comments in my Kindle.</p>
<p>But I was already doing paid Python projects after that, having fell in love with Python's language structure and especially it's interactive console that was lacking when I was using PHP. It opened my eyes for the possibilities for software engineering. Got $100 here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need to extract some data from a Google Maps location information page that is not available via either the Google Maps or Google Places API. See the following URL for example: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Khyber+Pass+Pub/@39.9486464,-75.146326,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x89c6c8857234d3e9:0xb5ec0b7cfcbf4cce!2sKhyber+Pass+Pub!8m2!3d39.9486423!4d-75.1441373!3m4!1s0x89c6c8857234d3e9:0xb5ec0b7cfcbf4cce!8m2!3d39.9486423!4d-75.1441373" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Khyber+Pass+Pub/@39.9486464,-75.146326,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x89c6c8857234d3e9:0xb5ec0b7cfcbf4cce!2sKhyber+Pass+Pub!8m2!3d39.9486423!4d-75.1441373!3m4!1s0x89c6c8857234d3e9:0xb5ec0b7cfcbf4cce!8m2!3d39.9486423!4d-75.1441373</a> The information panel shows a "Popular Times" section. We need to extract the popular times data for a specified location for all days and times. We need to do this via a script and not done by data entry as we will be turning this into a web based script to extract and store the data in a database.</p>

<p>I happily jumped at the chance and got this review</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mark did an incredible job on a very tough task. He wrote a fully commented Python script that gave us everything we asked for, and did it very quickly. We will definitely look for projects in the future that can use his skillset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You could see the results of what this Python program could do below. Just write in a business and it will return it's most popular active times by each day, which is what this client wanted. Luckily, in December 2019 it still hasn't broken yet!</p>
