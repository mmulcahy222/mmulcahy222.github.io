<p>I did full-stack development work for for a Nebraska real-estate company, and I helped make the WordPress pages for the residences, as well as assisted in the interactive maps to see which lots were available or not! The Lots were using Custom Post Types &amp; Advanced Custom Fields, and I transferred the data over from the main site to the new staging site.</p>
<p>The key to doing those interactive Google Maps was to use Python to extract the coordinates from a KML file generated in Google Earth. It was the only way. Google Maps API was then used to make those interactive maps from those coordinates files for each residence</p>
<p>You will not find any page-****.php file in the WordPress theme because Elementor was used to make it easier for admins to change the site, and I've made the templates for them. I have added a functions.php page in the theme however to call shortcodes &amp; to interface with the Elementor pages.</p>

<p>Wow! Mark's work was above and beyond. He was extremely responsive and is very talented. I would recommend him to others looking for high quality development work. He really took the time to understand the needs for the project and completed it sooner than needed! I plan on working with him again!</p>
