<p dir="auto">I know what you're thinking now.</p>
<p dir="auto">"BUT MARK!!! THE TASK MANAGER ALREADY DOES THE SAME THING!! What even is the purpose!"</p>
<p dir="auto">Super easy!</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The task manager takes 10-30 seconds to show up. The details tab takes a while. However, this popup comes up in 0.002 seconds. Very efficient!</li>
<li>How else can one know these inner details unless they practically do this themselves, such as getting these snapshots like PROCESSENTRY32 structure &amp; CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0);</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">The WM_TIMER in the Windows Procedure will update the popup every minute, it was activated with SetTimer(hWnd, 1, 1000, NULL) before the message loop.</p>

<p dir="auto">UPDATE:</p>
<p dir="auto">I added two more columns into this program months after I first created it, which are the "# of Handles" AND the "CPU Percentage", which makes it a total of five columns!</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Columns</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Process Name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Memory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Process ID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Handles</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CPU Percentage</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">The first four were easily retrievable with a few lines of advanced C++ Win32 API low-level calls. Just a few lines.</p>
<p dir="auto">I decided to have the number of Handles in the 4th column, because this is a feature that I only saw in SysInternals/Process Explorer, and NOT in the default Task Manager (except for Total # of Handles, not by process)</p>
<p dir="auto">Luckily for me the number of handles were retrievable by 4 lines of C++ code, like so:</p>
<p dir="auto">PDWORD handle_count_struct_instance = new DWORD;
GetProcessHandleCount(hProcess, handle_count_struct_instance);
int handle_count = *handle_count_struct_instance;
delete handle_count_struct_instance;</p>
<p dir="auto">Weirdly, I --HAD-- to make this into a HEAP object declared with "New" to get the code to even work, which I try to do a little as possible because of the potential of memory leaks.</p>
<p dir="auto">But now we're reaching the toughest of them all and that's the CPU Percentage!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p dir="auto">OH MY GOODNESS, what a freaking challenge. There are no Win32 calls to just simply get it, like there were with the three other columns. You had to do it yourself. I came this far, and I need this for diagnosing, so why was I going to stop. I get to learn something the way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, this required lots of studying &amp; homework &amp; taking together the best of many ideas to do so. Since this is using WM_TIMER, the last value of the Kernel/User/Exit/Creation time of the process had to have been recorded, which I did in a map (or a "Dict" of using Python). This was many hours of work with many tries &amp; many solutions.</p>
<p dir="auto">To see my solution at calculating the CPU percentage from a process, please view the code below!!! The great thing about it is that this solution mirrors the Task Manager CPU's percentage!!</p>
